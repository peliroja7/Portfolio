        </div>
        <span>29.1.2021 Strahinja Krstić</span> 
    <h2>1.	What’s the purpose of a free consultation with a Florida Personal Injury Lawyer?</h2>
        <p>First things first, it’s unsettling to think that a third party caused a personal injury to you. You must be asking yourself this: “Why did I deserve this?”, “Is there a lawyer just for these kinds of cases?”, “Are there any liable law companies I should be looking for?”, “What is a personal injury lawyer, and is this kind of lawyer suitable for my case?”. </p> 
        <p>When you are seeking compensation for cases regarding motorcycle accidents, car accidents, boating accidents, medical malpractice, animal attacks, elder care and nursing malpractice, product liability, slip and fall premises liability, wrongful death and we offer a possibility of sovereign immunity in Pompano Beach. Luckily for you, if you keep reading this article, LJ Law Group is going to explain everything in detail of what you have to do if you are considering to pursue a case. </p> 
        <p>This process starts with you contacting the law company (via the phone, e-mail, almost all law companies have a 24/7 support for your questions), then, a personal injury lawyer is going to answer your call. You do not have to worry about fees in this very early part of the process. The next step for you to do is to talk with a lawyer about a free consultation (no fees) with him/her. </p> 
        <p>The sole purpose for a free consultation is to discuss the basics of your case with your lawyer. This particularly helps the lawyer to know you better and for you to know him, and who represents you. Strategies regarding your case are going to be discussed, and if your case suits the lawyer’s experience. Here are some other things you need to keep in mind</p>
    <h2>2.	You have the right to ask questions</h2>       
        <p>Questions! Your lawyer is going to have some questions for you, and so will you, but this doesn’t mean you can’t be prepared. When you set a date for a free consultation, you will surely have some time to write down some questions for your lawyer in advance.</p>
        <p>This list of questions is going to help you determine whether your case and the law company are in the right fit. We understand that you’ve already been to other law companies and don’t feel that level of security to finally make a decision of which law company should represent you and your case. We at LJ Law Group have relevant experience in all personal injury cases, and our utmost concern is your wellbeing and the sense of security with us. </p>
         <p>When you make a list of prepared questions to ask us at the free consultation meeting, then you can make a rightful decision about the company that is going to represent you in the court of law. </p>  
    <h3>Questions you should be asking at your free consultation meeting:</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>What are we going to discuss in our first meeting?</li>
       <li>How long do these kinds of cases take to resolve?</li>
       <li>Are you going to be the lawyer who is going to represent me?</li>
       <li>Have you resolved similar cases like mine?</li>
       <li>How long have you been practicing?</li>
       <li>How does the billing process work?</li>
       <li>Do I have any other hidden sources of expenses?</li>
       <li>Am I corresponding with other lawyers in this office, or just you?</li>
       <li>What is the expected compensation for this kind of injury?</li>
       <li>Are there any specific laws I should be looking out for in Florida?</li>
       <li>What are the ways for me to pay you?</li>
       <li>How much must I wait before my settlement resolves?</li>
    </ul> 
        <p>Most importantly, all these questions above are merely guidelines that are going to help you better prepare. But, just like every person is different, every case is different. So, you also need to write down some specific questions that are unique to your case. It goes without saying: “having more or enough is better than not having enough!”. </p>   
    <h2>3.	What sort of documents do you have to provide?</h2>
        <p>Here we have the more technical part of the process. Make the most of your situation and gather as much evidence and information of your case as you can. This is the essential part of the process, and it will help clarify your case to your lawyers, but will also help you be more certain of the process. </p>
    <h3>Some of the most important documentation are the following:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>relevant photos of the accident scene</li>
       <li>photos of your injuries</li>
       <li>medical records that will help prove your injury </li>
       <li>official reports regarding your incident</li>
        <li>police citations</li>
       <li>laboratory test results</li>
       <li>prescriptions you may have taken or still take</li>
       <li>government issued IDs</li>
       <li>doctor reports</li>
       <li>witness information</li>
       <li>receipts for any injury related expenses</li>
       <li>your personal notes</li>
       <li>any other relevant information</li>
    </ul>
        <p>Like we said, there is no case just like the other, some of these documents may not apply to your case, which is completely fine.</p>
        <p>If you want advice about your personal notes, please hear us out. The human memory can be, after some time, prone to deprive of quality details of your personal injury, so take our advice and write down your personal notes, so you won’t forget them over time, they are so important.</p>
        <p>Of course, we understand you cannot remember every little thing and detail, but try to remember and write down a relevant chain of events that brought down the incident, who was there, how much time it took, how were you affected and were you in any way assisted.</p> 
    <p>Having this in one place will not only help in a big amount to your lawyer, but it will also up your chances of winning in court.</p>
    <h2>4.	Florida state laws and evaluating if you have a case</h2>
    <p>This section is about the determination if you have a case. Every state has its own regulations concerning personal injuries. Here are some of the laws in the Florida state regarding personal injuries:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dog bite cases: Florida has a strict liability policy regarding dog bites. The owner is held responsible, regardless of the dog’s past behavior. </li>
      
       <li>Florida law allows injured victims to file a personal injury lawsuit after a traffic accident if it resulted in a serious injury to you. A serious injury is defined under Florida law to include any of the following types of injuries: a permanent injury, significant and permanent scarring or disfigurement, significant and permanent loss of bodily function and death</li>
       
       <li>Product liability claims: Product liability arises when a person is injured by a defective consumer product. Florida applies strict liability principles to these claims, meaning that it imposes a duty on product manufacturers to make products safe. </li>
       
       <li>To establish negligence, you must satisfy certain elements. You must first show that the defendant owed you a duty of care. For example, in a medical malpractice case, you must show that the health care provider owed you a duty to act according to accepted medical practices. </li>
    </ul>
        <p>These are just some of the laws in Florida. After a free consultation with your lawyer, he will be the one to make the decision if you have a case. </p>
        <p>The determination if you have a case can take some time, lawyers are busy people, they need time to get through the documentation and to re-evaluate everything. </p>
        <p>Now this is the part when you should be considering fees and signing the needed documentation that the lawyers give you, so you can hire them. After this, the completion of these next steps can vary because of insurance policies, witness information, and the process of beginning a lawsuit. Because this process takes significant time, you can contact us during this time of waiting.</p>
