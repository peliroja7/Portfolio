        <h2>What is muscle hypertrophy?</h2>
        <p>Muscular hypertrophy or muscle soreness that you feel after a workout refers to one of the factors that contribute to muscle growth. There are two types of muscular hypertrophy:  </p> <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Myofibrillar hypertrophy: which occurs in myofibrils and these are the essential bundles of myofilaments (when you contract your muscles during a rep, that is, when you pull something). They are found in each skeletal muscle group.</li>
        </ul> 
       <p>Myofibril hypertrophy occurs when you “overload” your muscles. When you work out with lower reps and longer rest periods, you apply the stress and “trauma” to the muscles you are working out. The golden rule is that muscles DO NOT grow when you are working out, they grow then you are having adequate sleep. How does this work? With a minimum of 7 hours of sleep, your body (muscles) recover from this stress or “trauma” for the next training session, so they won’t get “damaged” next time. You have to remember, our muscles are “smarter” than you think, and our body is a perfect “adapting machine”. So, you constantly have to apply additional stress a.k.a, more intensity almost every time during your training session to continue making gains. </p>
       <ul><li>Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy: The sarcoplasm is the fluid and one of the main sources of energy that surrounds the myofilaments. It contains several elements: water, creatine phosphate, ATP, and glycogen. When you work out with higher reps and shorter rest periods, there is an increase of blood vessels in your muscles, so it’s basically the same principle as myofibrillar hypertrophy. The only difference is that your body constantly increases the energy storages that we talked about (sarcoplasmic fluid = water, creatine phosphate, etc.) so that you don’t completely deplete your energy storages the next time you train. The key point here is the increase of capillarization in the muscles. </li></ul>
       <h2>How do I train for muscle hypertrophy?</h2>
       <p>We need to stage another golden rule for muscle growth. In the part of myofibrillar hypertrophy, we talked about “the overload of the muscles”. There is a well-known definition of this: Progressive resistance exercise or progressive overload refers to the practice of continually increasing the stress placed on the muscle as it becomes capable of producing greater force or has more endurance. This means that you MUST use weights and rep ranges that you struggle with. It goes with the saying: “you need to get comfortable being uncomfortable”, during the training of course. </p>
       <p>Myofibrillar hypertrophy training: or strength training is another term. This is when you do reps that are about 80% of your 1RM (one rep maximum of an exercise that you can lift). Typically, the rep range is 3-8 per set, and the rest period is 2-4 minutes. Myofibril hypertrophy equals lifting heavy! Every time you lift heavier in the next training session (or when you feel like it that you can), more muscle fibers are recruited and damaged. We have to go back to the adequate sleep part. We can’t emphasize this enough, it’s a crucial part of the recovery process, so you can move forward to your strength training. </p>
       <p>Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy training: or fatigue training is the other term. This is accomplished through training at an intensity of 75% 1RM with a rep range of 10-15 and rest periods of 45-90 seconds. Why is it called fatigue training? Because it rapidly and directly uses up all energy storage in your muscles. </p>
       <p>We will tell you a little secret that is called time under tension, this is vital for muscle fatigues. There is a minimum time required for sarcoplasmic hypertrophy to occur. </p>
       <p>This is the “catch”. There is an “immediate storage of energy” in your muscles that typically deplete in about 10 seconds in one rep of an exercise. So, it’s completely logical. You just have to make sure that your time under tension is HIGHER than the immediate storage of energy in your muscles. In conclusion, you have to maintain a time under tension little above 10 seconds, so your muscles can produce lactic acid, or “the burn” you feel when you are doing your reps. You can achieve this in two ways:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Slower reps, when you are really squeezing your muscles during contraction;</li>
           <li>Supersets. when you are doing two complementary exercises as one rep, without rest in between (example: doing a bench press and right after, without rest, doing a barbell bench press).</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Hypertrophy rep ranges</h2>
       <p>There is a spectrum through which myofibril and sarcoplasmic hypertrophy occur:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>1-5 Reps - Lead to a maximum increase in relative strength and myofibril recruitment.</li>
           <li>6-8 Reps - Produce the best medium between myofibril and sarcoplasmic hypertrophy.</li>
           <li>9-12 Reps - Increase sarcoplasmic hypertrophy at the maximum rate.</li>
           <li>>15 Reps - You move into the range of muscular endurance where hypertrophy gains slow.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>This is the interesting thing when you are above the 12 rep range, myofibril damage will not occur at a higher degree, on the contrary, it will be lesser and with less muscle fiber than at lower reps. </p>
       <p>Now that you’ve read all this, we need to “rounds things up”, so if you keep on reading, we will tell you the secret of combining both training sessions and have MAXIMUM results!</p>
        <h2>The “golden combination”</h2>
        <p>To achieve maximum hypertrophy and get the best from both sides you can do this combination: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Week 1: Strength training, 4-day split.</li>
            <li>Week 2: Fatigue training, 5-day split.</li>
            <li>Week 3: Recovery, 2-day full body split.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The point here is to elaborate the meaning of these three “bullet-points”. Strength training is focusing on myofibril hypertrophy, the muscles you combine are to your liking, and you can do it for the rest of these workout splits. Fatigue training, as we said, is focused on sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, and the reason we added a 5-day split, not four on the previous split, is that there is a general tendency for people to be more resilient to fatigue training (just remember, everybody is different and has a different genetical structure). The last split is for “rounding everything up” and it’s a 2-day full body split that can be exhausting, so that’s the main reason it’s split in two days, but you can add it up to a 3-day full body split. </p>
        <p>A study comparing the effects of linear vs. periodization changes in college athletes showed that the linear trained athlete’s strength increased 14.15% over 12 weeks compared to 23.53% for the athletes using periodized training programs. </p>
